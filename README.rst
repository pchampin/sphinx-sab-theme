Slides-and-book theme
#####################

This is a theme for Sphinx and Hieroglyph,
for making a document available both as a

* a set of "standard" HTML pages (with the ``html`` builder), and
* an HTML slideshow (with the ``slides`` builder).

In addition,
the single HTML page produced by the ``singlehtml`` builder
produces a nice printed version provided that
the class ``sab-printable`` is set to the top-level title in ``index.rst``.
